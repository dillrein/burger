Node Express Handlebars homework


Was having difficulty getting the localhost connection to start. Made it difficult to test if the app was correctly working. 

I used hot_restaurant catsApp and HotdogApp as example to draw coding from.

I'm still working on this and determined to get this to work.

Other than the connection error I know I need to do the follow.


To-do: (in no particular order)
-Deploy to heroku.
-Fine tune and adjust html / css
-Error check buttons:
    - create 
    - devoured
-Proper readme file
